# Technique Stacking

You don't learn skills. You collect techniques until the skill emerges.

---

## The Problem

Most people try to learn skills as a whole.

> "I want to learn React."

That's not a skill. That's a 10,000-hour mountain you're staring at from the bottom.

Your brain sees the entire mountain, panics, and you end up watching tutorials forever.

---

## The Reframe

Skills are puzzles. Techniques are pieces.

You don't "learn React." You learn:
- How to manage state in a component
- How to pass props
- How to handle side effects
- How to structure a project

Stack enough pieces, the picture forms itself.

---

## The Structure

```
1. PURPOSE     → What are you actually trying to build/do?
2. BLOCKER     → What's the ONE thing stopping you right now?
3. TECHNIQUE   → Learn only what unblocks you
4. APPLY       → Use it immediately
5. STACK       → Move to the next blocker, repeat
```

## How to Teach With This

When explaining anything, break it into stackable pieces:

**Weak:**
> "Let me explain how authentication works in web apps."

**Strong:**
> "Authentication has three pieces: identifying the user, proving they are who they claim, and remembering that proof. Let's start with the first one."

Give them one piece. Let them hold it. Then add the next.

## The 80/20 Reality

Most skills follow a power law:

| Techniques Learned | Skill Unlocked |
|-------------------|----------------|
| 5-10 core techniques | 80% of practical ability |
| Next 50 techniques | 15% refinement |
| Everything else | 5% mastery/edge cases |

You don't need the whole puzzle to see the picture. You need 20% of the pieces in the right places.

## Examples

| Skill | First 5 Techniques to Stack |
|-------|----------------------------|
| Running faster | Cadence, foot strike, arm swing, breathing rhythm, pacing |
| React Native | Components, state, navigation, styling, API calls |
| Public speaking | Opening hook, pacing, eye contact, structure, closing |

Notice: These aren't comprehensive. They're *enough to start doing the thing*.

## When to Use This

- **Teaching complex topics** — Break the mountain into rocks
- **Learning new skills yourself** — Stop consuming, start stacking
- **Motivating stuck people** — Show them the first piece, not the whole puzzle

---

## One Line Summary

**Don't learn skills. Stack techniques until the skill appears.**
