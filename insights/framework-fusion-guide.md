# Framework Fusion

One framework makes a point. Multiple frameworks make it unforgettable.

---

## The Problem

Beginners use one framework at a time.

> Contrarian opening. Done. Next video.

It works. But it's predictable. Audiences learn to see it coming.

---

## The Level Up

Once you've internalized individual frameworks, combine them.

Not randomly — strategically. Each framework does a different job.

---

## The Combination Matrix

| If You Need... | Combine These |
|----------------|---------------|
| Hook + Credibility | Contrarian Opening → Experience Anchor |
| Teach + Engage | Technique Stacking → Dopamine Ladder |
| Challenge + Land | Contrarian Opening → Punch-Expand-Ground |
| Story + Lesson | Experience Anchor → Technique Stacking |

## Example: Full Fusion

**Topic:** Why senior devs mass-delete code

```
[CONTRARIAN OPENING]
"The best code I ever wrote got deleted six months later."

[EXPERIENCE ANCHOR]
"I spent two weeks on a caching layer. Beautiful abstraction.
Then I watched a junior engineer struggle to debug it for three days.
That's when I realized: complexity I understood was complexity
someone else would inherit."

[TECHNIQUE STACKING]
"There are three techniques senior devs use to know what to delete:
1. If you have to explain it more than twice, it's too clever.
2. If the abstraction serves one use case, inline it.
3. If you wrote it to 'prepare for the future,' the future doesn't want it."

[PUNCH-EXPAND-GROUND]
"The best code isn't code you write. It's code you prevent."
```

Four frameworks. One cohesive piece. Each doing its job.

## The Rules of Fusion

1. **Max 3-4 per piece** — More than that feels overengineered
2. **Lead with hook frameworks** — Contrarian Opening, Stimulation
3. **Build with structure frameworks** — Technique Stacking, Dopamine Ladder
4. **Land with punch frameworks** — Punch-Expand-Ground, Experience Anchor
5. **Don't force it** — If a framework doesn't fit, skip it

---

## Practice Drill

Take any topic you know. Write it three ways:

1. Single framework only
2. Two frameworks combined
3. Three+ frameworks fused

Feel the difference in depth and memorability.

## One Line Summary

**Stack frameworks like techniques. Each one does a job. Together, they're unstoppable.**
