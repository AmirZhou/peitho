# The Speed Stack

Density is respect. Every second should earn its place.

## The Problem

Most content wastes time:

- 30-second intros asking you to subscribe
- Restating what they're about to say
- Filler phrases ("basically," "you know," "kind of")
- Padding to hit a time target

Viewers feel it. They leave.

## The Fireship Standard

Fireship's "100 seconds" videos pack what others take 10 minutes to say.

No intro. No filler. No wasted frames.

Every sentence delivers information. Every cut serves a purpose.

---

## The Principles

| Principle | What It Means |
|-----------|---------------|
| **No throat-clearing** | Start with the content, not "Hey guys, so today..." |
| **One idea per sentence** | Don't stack clauses. Deliver. Move on. |
| **Cut the air** | Remove pauses, "umms," transitions that add nothing |
| **Visual-verbal sync** | What you say = what they see. No lag. |
| **Speed varies** | Fast through obvious parts. Slow for key insights. |

---

## The Structure

```
1. HOOK         → First sentence is the payoff preview (2 seconds)
2. CONTEXT      → Minimum viable background (5-10 seconds)
3. MEAT         → Core content, rapid-fire (bulk of the time)
4. LAND         → Compressed takeaway (5 seconds)
```

No "before we begin." No "let me know in the comments." Just content.

## The Density Test

After writing a script, do a **word audit:**

| Cut These | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| "Basically" | Adds nothing |
| "Just" | Weakens the point |
| "Actually" | Usually unnecessary |
| "So," (at start) | Throat-clearing |
| "In order to" | Replace with "to" |
| "That being said" | Just say the next thing |

Read your script. Cut 20%. Still makes sense? Cut another 10%.

## Speed Modulation

Fast isn't always better. Vary the pace:

| When | Speed |
|------|-------|
| Background info | Fast |
| Key insight | Slow down |
| List of items | Rapid-fire |
| The one thing to remember | Pause. Slow. Emphasize. |

Constant speed = monotone. Variation = attention.

---

## When to Use This

- **Short-form content** — You have 30-60 seconds. No room for waste.
- **Tutorials** — Respect their time. Get to the point.
- **Hooks** — First 3 seconds must be dense.

---

## One Line Summary

**Treat every second like it costs money. Because it costs attention — which is worth more.**
