# The Coach Voice

Content creators share information. Coaches change behavior.

## The Problem

Most coaching content sounds like this:

> "Make sure you have good running form. Keep your cadence up. Stay relaxed."

Generic. Forgettable. Could be written by someone who's never coached.

Real coaching is specific, physical, and lands in the body — not just the mind.

---

## The Shift

Information tells people what to do.

Coaching tells them **how it should feel**.

---

## The Structure

```
1. DIAGNOSIS    → Name exactly what they're doing wrong
2. REFRAME      → Why their instinct makes sense but doesn't work
3. CUE          → One specific thing to try (physical or mental)
4. FEEL         → What success feels like when they get it right
```

## Example: Running Coaching

**Topic:** Overstriding

```
[DIAGNOSIS]
"You're reaching with your foot. Landing ahead of your body,
heel first, leg straight. Every step is a brake."

[REFRAME]
"Your brain thinks longer strides = faster running. It's intuitive.
It's also wrong. You're not pushing forward — you're pulling yourself
over your leg. That's wasted energy and injury risk."

[CUE]
"Here's the fix: think about your feet landing underneath your hips,
not in front. Imagine you're running on hot coals — quick, light contact.
Don't reach. Let the ground come to you."

[FEEL]
"When you get this right, it feels like falling forward. Less effort,
not more. Your legs are recycling underneath you, not pounding ahead.
You'll feel smoother before you feel faster. That's the sign it's working."
```

## The "Feel" Library

Build a collection of feeling descriptions for your domain:

| Concept | How It Feels |
|---------|--------------|
| Proper cadence | "Like a metronome is in your legs" |
| Relaxed shoulders | "Like your arms are hanging from strings" |
| Good foot strike | "Quiet landing — you shouldn't hear your feet" |
| Flow state coding | "The code writes itself, you're just watching" |
| Clean architecture | "Every file is exactly where you'd expect it" |

Feelings stick. Instructions fade.

## Coach Voice vs. Teacher Voice

| Teacher | Coach |
|---------|-------|
| "Here's how it works" | "Here's what you're doing wrong" |
| Explains the concept | Fixes the mistake |
| General principles | Specific cues |
| "Understand this" | "Try this right now" |

Both are valid. Know which mode you're in.

## The Authority Balance

Coaching requires authority. But not arrogance.

**Too soft:**
> "Maybe try thinking about your cadence? If that feels right to you?"

**Too hard:**
> "You're doing it completely wrong. Stop everything."

**Coach voice:**
> "Here's what I'm seeing. Here's what to try. Here's how you'll know it's working."

Direct. Specific. Supportive.

---

## When to Use This

- **Technique breakdowns** — Form corrections, common mistakes
- **Mindset shifts** — Reframing how they think about the skill
- **Progress markers** — Telling them what "good" feels like so they can self-coach

---

## One Line Summary

**Don't tell them what to do. Tell them how it should feel.**
