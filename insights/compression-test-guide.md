# The Compression Test

If you can't say it in one sentence, you don't understand it yet.

## The Problem

Most content is padded. Filler words. Redundant explanations. Throat-clearing.

> "So basically what I'm trying to say here is that, you know, in my experience at least, it seems like..."

By the time you get to the point, they've scrolled away.

## The Naval Standard

Naval Ravikant speaks in compressed packets. Complete ideas in single sentences:

> "Escape competition through authenticity."

> "Read what you love until you love to read."

> "Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity."

No setup. No padding. Just the idea.

## The Test

Before you deliver any point, ask:

**"Can I say this in one sentence?"**

If yes → Lead with that sentence, then expand if needed.

If no → You don't understand the idea clearly enough yet.

## The Structure

```
1. COMPRESS     → Force the idea into one sentence
2. LEAD         → Open with that sentence
3. EXPAND       → Only add context if necessary
4. CALLBACK     → End by repeating the compression
```

## Example

**Before compression:**
> "So one thing I've learned over time is that when you're trying to build an audience, you really need to focus on being yourself because there are so many people out there trying to copy what works and the thing is, if you just copy someone else, you're always going to be a worse version of them, so it's better to just be authentically you."

**After compression:**
> "You can't beat someone at being themselves. Stop copying. Be the only version of you."

Same idea. One-tenth the words. Ten times the impact.

## When to Use This

- **Opening hooks** — Compressed = punchy
- **Key takeaways** — Make them quotable
- **Endings** — Land with a compressed truth
- **Tweets / short posts** — The whole post is the compression

## The Practice Drill

Take any paragraph you've written. Compress it to one sentence.

If you can't, rewrite until you can.

This is how you find your actual point.

## One Line Summary

**Compression is clarity. If it takes a paragraph, you haven't found the insight yet.**
