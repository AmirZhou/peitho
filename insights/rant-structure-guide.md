# The Rant Structure

Opinions without structure are noise. Structured frustration is content.

## The Problem

Most rants go like this:

> "JavaScript is so annoying. Why does this even exist. I hate this. Anyway..."

No point. No payoff. Just vibes.

You might feel better. Your audience learns nothing.

## The T3gg / Prime Pattern

Watch their best rants. They're not random. There's a shape:

1. Something triggers them
2. They escalate why it matters
3. They diagnose the root cause
4. They establish what "good" looks like
5. They challenge the audience

That's not complaining. That's teaching through frustration.

## The Structure

```
1. TRIGGER       → The specific thing that set you off
2. ESCALATE      → Why this is worse than it looks
3. ROOT CAUSE    → The real reason this keeps happening
4. STANDARD      → What it should be instead
5. CHALLENGE     → What you want the audience to do/think
```

## Example: Coding Rant

**Topic:** Developers who don't read error messages

```
[TRIGGER]
"Someone in my Discord just asked why their code wasn't working.
The error message literally said 'Cannot read property of undefined on line 47.'
They didn't read it. They just panicked and asked for help."

[ESCALATE]
"This isn't one person. This is an epidemic. I see it every day.
Developers with years of experience who treat error messages like
pop-up ads — something to close, not read."

[ROOT CAUSE]
"Here's why this happens: tutorials don't fail. Every YouTube tutorial
works perfectly. You never see the instructor debug. So when errors
happen to you, you think you're broken. You're not. You just never
learned that errors are the curriculum."

[STANDARD]
"Every error message is a teacher. It's telling you exactly what's wrong,
usually with a line number. The standard should be: read it fully,
Google the exact text, then ask for help. In that order."

[CHALLENGE]
"Next time you get an error, screenshot it. Read every word.
If you still can't solve it after 15 minutes of actual effort,
then ask. But not before."
```

## The Energy Spectrum

Rants work on a spectrum. Calibrate to the situation:

| Level | Tone | When to Use |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **1 - Observation** | "This is interesting..." | Minor annoyances, hot takes |
| **2 - Frustration** | "This drives me crazy..." | Common bad practices |
| **3 - Full Rant** | "This needs to stop..." | Industry-wide problems |

Don't go level 3 every time. It loses impact.

## The Difference: Rant vs. Complaint

| Complaint | Rant |
|-----------|------|
| Points at problem | Points at solution |
| Makes you feel heard | Makes audience think |
| Ends with frustration | Ends with challenge |
| About you | About them |

If your rant doesn't teach something, it's just a complaint.

---

## When to Use This

- **Hot takes on tooling** — "Why I stopped using X"
- **Industry bad practices** — "This is why juniors struggle"
- **Counter-narratives** — "Everyone says X, but actually..."

## One Line Summary

**Frustration is fuel. Structure turns it into content.**
