# Why People Don't Take You Seriously

It's not because they don't like you.

That's the lazy explanation you tell yourself so you don't have to change.

---

## The Default Excuse

When someone dismisses your idea, your brain goes:

> "They just don't like me. Nothing I can do."

Wrong.

90% of the time, it's something you're doing—or not doing.

## Three Reasons You're Not Taken Seriously

1. You don't keep promises
2. You speak without confidence
3. You speak without thought

Fix these. Everything changes.

## 1. You Don't Keep Promises

Not just to others. To yourself.

You said you'd go to the gym 5x this week. You went twice.

You said you'd send it by EOD. You sent it tomorrow.

You think no one noticed. They did.

**The math:** If you don't respect your own word, why should anyone else?

Every broken micro-promise erodes your credibility. Not dramatically—slowly. Until one day you realize people stopped listening to you and you don't know why.

**The fix:** Do what you say. Every time. Even the small things.

Especially the small things.

## 2. You Speak Unconfidently

Three fixes:

### Use Downspeak

End sentences with a downward tone, not upward.

**Weak:** "So we wanted to get your thoughts on the presentation?"

**Strong:** "We want your thoughts on the presentation."

The first sounds like you're asking permission to exist. The second sounds like you belong.

### Speak in Structure

Before you open your mouth, know your structure.

> "I want to cover three things: X, Y, and Z. Let's start with X."

This alone puts you ahead of most people who ramble until they find their point.

### End With a CTA

Never just dump information.

**Weak:** "So yeah... that's the analysis."

**Strong:** "That's the analysis. What we need from you: feedback on section 2, and whether this is ready for the VP meeting."

Be prescriptive. Tell them exactly what you need.

Vague asks get ignored. Specific asks get responses.

## 3. You're Not Being Thoughtful

You speak often. But you don't say much.

You're the person who raises their hand for participation points. You chime in to be seen, not to contribute.

People notice. They stop listening.

**The bar of quality:**

Think of it like pole vaulting. Everyone has a bar. If your contribution clears it, they listen. If it doesn't, they tune you out.

The more you speak below the bar, the lower they set their expectations of you.

**The fix:** Speak less. Think more.

Before any meeting:
- What do I want to say?
- What do I want from them?
- How will they receive this given what they already know?

That last one is where most people fail. They never consider the other person's POV.

If you do, you're already ahead.

---

## The Empathy Edge

People take you seriously when they feel understood.

Not when you dump your brilliant ideas on them.

Not when you speak loudly and often.

When they think: "This person actually considered my perspective before opening their mouth."

That's rare. Be that person.

---

## The Recap

**Out of your control:** Some people won't like you. That's their problem.

**In your control:**

| Problem | Fix |
|--------|-----|
| Broken promises | Do what you say. Always. |
| Weak delivery | Downspeak. Structure. CTA. |
| Low-value input | Think before you speak. Consider their POV. |

---

## The Real Issue

You're not taken seriously because you haven't given people a reason to take you seriously.

Words are cheap. Everyone has opinions.

What's rare:
- Someone who keeps their word
- Someone who speaks with clarity
- Someone who thinks before they talk

Be rare.
