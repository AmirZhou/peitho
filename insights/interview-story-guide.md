# The Interview Story Framework

You're not failing interviews because of your resume.

You're failing because you can't tell a story.

---

## The Problem

When asked "Tell me about yourself," most candidates do this:

> "I'm from Boston. I go to Georgetown. I study public policy. I interned at a startup. I want to do consulting. I like cooking and basketball."

A list of facts. No narrative. No connection. No differentiation.

You sound like everyone else because you're *presenting* like everyone else.

---

## The Three Questions

Your story must answer exactly three questions:

1. **Where are you from?** — Context
2. **Why are you here?** — Connection
3. **Where do you want to go?** — Intent

Most people answer #1 and skip #2 and #3.

That's why they lose.

## The Fix: Connect the Dots

Stop listing. Start weaving.

**Bad:**
> "I interned at a startup. Now I want consulting."

**Good:**
> "What I loved about that internship was working with the CEO on competitive strategy—figuring out if a new market entrant was a threat, mapping our options, then operationalizing the decision. That's why consulting feels like the logical next step."

The difference: *demonstrated reflection*.

## Transition Phrases That Work

Use these to connect experiences:

- "What I enjoyed most about that was..."
- "As I reflected on that experience, I realized..."
- "That's what made me look for opportunities where I could..."
- "Which is exactly why..."

These prove you didn't just *do* things—you *learned* from them.

---

## Show Effort, Not Just Interest

Saying "I'm interested in your company" means nothing.

Saying "I spoke with [Name] who told me about [Specific Program] and that's exactly what I'm looking for" means everything.

Two ways to demonstrate effort:

1. **Network before the interview** — Reference actual conversations
2. **Research deeply** — Know specific programs, initiatives, recent moves

This puts you above 50% of candidates instantly.

## End on a High Note

Don't end with hobbies. End with energy.

**Bad ending:**
> "In my personal life I enjoy reading and sports."

**Good ending:**
> "When I saw you were recruiting on campus, I was genuinely excited. The conversations I've had with your team confirmed this is exactly where I want to be. I'm ready to get into it."

Most candidates are too nervous to show excitement.

Be the one who isn't.

## The Framework

```
1. Context       → Where you're from, what you studied, and WHY
2. Experience    → What you did and what you LEARNED (not just tasks)
3. Reflection    → What that made you realize you want
4. Connection    → Why THIS company answers that want
5. Energy        → Genuine excitement to be here
```

---

## Why This Works

Everyone has similar facts.
Similar schools. Similar internships. Similar clubs.

Your edge isn't your resume.

Your edge is how you *connect* what you've done into a narrative only you can tell.

**Stop listing experiences. Start building a story.**

The interviewer should finish your pitch thinking:
> "It makes complete sense why they're here."

If they're not thinking that, you haven't answered the three questions.

## One More Thing

Don't lie. Don't exaggerate.

The person across the table does this job every day. They'll smell BS immediately.

And even if you somehow get hired on false pretenses—you'll have to perform.

The truth, told well, always wins.
