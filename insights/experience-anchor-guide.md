# The Experience Anchor

Your opinion means nothing without proof you've lived it.

---

## The Problem

Most people share opinions like this:

> "State management in React is overcomplicated."

Cool take. So what?

No story. No credibility. No reason to believe you over anyone else.

---

## The Fix: Anchor to Experience

Every strong opinion needs a story that proves you earned it.

**Weak:**
> "Developers should run more. It helps with focus."

**Strong:**
> "I was stuck on a bug for three hours. Went for a 5k. Solved it in my head by mile two. Now I run before every hard problem."

The difference: **demonstrated experience**, not borrowed wisdom.

## The Structure

```
1. OPINION      → State your take clearly
2. ANCHOR       → Tell the moment that taught you this
3. LESSON       → What you realized from that moment
4. TRANSFER     → Why this applies to them too
```

## Transition Phrases That Work

Use these to bridge from opinion to story:

- "I learned this the hard way when..."
- "This clicked for me after..."
- "I used to think the opposite, until..."
- "The moment that changed my mind was..."

These signal: *I'm not just theorizing — I've lived this.*

## The Credibility Stack

The more specific your story, the more believable your opinion.

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| "I've seen this fail" | "I watched a team burn 3 sprints on premature abstraction" |
| "Running helps thinking" | "Mile two of a 10k in the rain, the architecture clicked" |
| "Tutorials don't work" | "I did 47 React tutorials before I built anything real" |

Specificity = credibility. Vague = forgettable.

## When to Use This

- **Contrarian takes** — Anchor proves you're not just being edgy
- **Teaching moments** — Story makes the lesson stick
- **Building trust** — Shows you've done the thing, not just read about it

---

## The Rule

Never share an opinion you can't anchor to a lived experience.

If you can't, either:
1. Go get the experience first
2. Don't share the opinion yet

Borrowed wisdom sounds borrowed. Earned wisdom resonates.

## One Line Summary

**Your story is your proof. No story, no credibility.**
