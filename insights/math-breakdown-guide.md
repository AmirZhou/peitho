# The Math Breakdown

Opinions are debatable. Math isn't.

## The Problem

Most content argues with words. Words are soft. Easy to dismiss.

> "You should post more consistently."

Says who? Why? How much?

## The Hormozi Move

Alex Hormozi makes points undeniable by showing the math:

> "If you post once a day for a year, that's 365 pieces. If 1% go viral, that's 3-4 breakout moments. Most people quit at 30 posts. They never gave the math a chance to work."

Now it's not an opinion. It's arithmetic.

## The Structure

```
1. CLAIM        → State what you believe
2. QUANTIFY     → Attach numbers to it
3. CALCULATE    → Show the math step by step
4. CONTRAST     → Compare to what most people do
5. CONCLUDE     → Make the obvious conclusion
```

## Example: Coding Content

**Topic:** Why side projects beat tutorials

```
[CLAIM]
"Building beats watching."

[QUANTIFY]
"Let's do the math. Average tutorial: 2 hours.
Retention after one week: maybe 10%.
So you keep 12 minutes of learning from 2 hours of watching."

[CALCULATE]
"That same 2 hours spent building something — even failing —
gives you: error messages you'll remember, Stack Overflow
searches you'll reuse, muscle memory you can't unlearn.
Retention: 60-70%."

[CONTRAST]
"Most people watch 50 tutorials before building once.
That's 100 hours for 10 hours of retained learning.
Builders get there in 15 hours."

[CONCLUDE]
"Tutorials feel productive. Building is productive.
The math doesn't lie."
```

## Types of Math That Work

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Time math** | "That's 2 hours/day x 365 = 730 hours/year" |
| **Money math** | "At $50/hour, that bug cost you $500" |
| **Probability math** | "1% chance x 100 attempts = near certainty" |
| **Comparison math** | "10x the effort for 2x the result" |

## When to Use This

- **Motivating consistency** — Show the compound effect
- **Killing excuses** — Math exposes bad logic
- **Making decisions obvious** — When the numbers speak
- **Building credibility** — Shows you've thought it through

---

## One Line Summary

**Give them the math. Let the numbers make your argument.**
